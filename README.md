# MTLib #

## What is this Library? ##
This is a library built over the years. It was originally built as only a multithreading library for C++, that was lightweight, extremely quick, easy to use, and cross platform. It has since transformed to include error handling, logging, and basic configuration parsing. All Cross Platform. All The Time.

## Can I Run MTLib? ##
MTLib should be able to run on any OS you throw at it that can run C++11. Of course if you have any bugs please follow the steps in "Filing a Bug Report", and report the bugs to me through here (github). Although as I said before it should be basically compatible with anything that runs the language it is written in.

## Filing A Bug Report ##
Let's say something in the library goes wrong, and it just blows up in your face (hopefully not literally). Please go over to the issues page, and create a new issue. In your issue report remember to include any sort of logs that are left behind, as well as the most amount of info you can give about what your system is/what it is running. The more information your provide the quicker the debug time, and the quicker it will get fixed. Probably.

## I want to contribute to MTLib! ##
Well it's basically set, but if you want to contribute to it please feel free to submit a PR. However note. PR's are accepted are the pure mercy of myself. Please note the goal is to keep the library lightweight as possible, OS-Independent, and flexible to fit everyone's needs.
